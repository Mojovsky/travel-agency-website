This project is a simple, static website. I will go through the main aspects below.

1. Header

   - Search icon (inactive)
   - Home button (active)
   - Burger button (mobile view/inactive)
   - Links to Destinations and Contact Form (desktop view/active)
   - Booking Form (inactive, all basic functionalities)

2. Homepage

   - 3 paragraphs of text
   - 4 destination cards (active, currently linking to gallery due to lack of individual pages)

3. Gallery

   - 12 destination cards (only the first active, leading to individual page)

4. Individual destination page

   - 3 paragraphs of desciptive text
   - 6 destination cards
   - "Back to gallery" button

5. Contact Form

   - Name field (required)
   - Email field (required)
   - Phone number (not required)
   - Message box (required)
   - "Submit" button (active, redirects to confirmation page)

6. Contact Form Confirmation

   Confirms the successful submission and redirects to homepage automatically after 4 seconds

7. Footer

   - Home link (active)
   - Destinations link (active)
   - About link (inactive)
   - Contact (active)
   - Newsletter (inactive/email field and button)

## Areas for improvement

    Where to begin...

    1. Modify header depending on the page (no need for booking for "Contact Form" etc.)
    2. Make active burger button on mobile view
    3. Tidy up code, make classes and styles more uniform (especially cards and buttons/links)
    4. Make "About" link active and direct to a simple webpage
    5. Make "Newsletter" subscription confirmation page (similar to contact form)
    6. Make search icon semi-active (input field on hover)
